      <h1>Meet the Founders:</h1>
        <p>Bond Voyage was founded over the Summer of 2025 by two Stuyvesant juniors, Grace Yang and Sophia Chen when they were bored. They were aiming to do something for fun, through combining their separate interests in finance/economics and computer science/programming. The idea to start a blog website sparked when discussing previous reports Sophia wrote for an internship blog, and Graceâ€™s previous website developing experience. Though originally developed just for fun, they hope to create a free, easily accessible website for students interested in finance and tech to share their research and knowledge with other students. </p>
