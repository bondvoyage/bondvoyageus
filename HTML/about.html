      <h1>Meet the Founders:</h1>
        <p>Bond Voyage was founded in the summer of 2025 by two Stuyvesant juniors, Grace Yang and Sophia Chen, when they decided to turn bordeom into creativity. 
           They set out to build something for fun through combining their separate interests in finance and computer science. The idea for a student publication
           grew out of Sophia's past internship writing reports and Grace's previous website developing experience. What started as a casual summer project has since
           evolved into a platform to provide students interested in finance and tech with a free, accessible space to share their research and knowledge.
